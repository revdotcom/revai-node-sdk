# Rev.ai Node SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/revdotcom/revai-node-sdk.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/revdotcom/revai-node-sdk)

## Documentation

See the [API docs](https://www.rev.ai/docs) for more information about the API.

## Examples

Examples can be found in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/revdotcom/revai-node-sdk/tree/develop/samples) directory

## Installation

To install the package, run:

    npm install revai-node-sdk

## Support

We support Node 8, 10, and 12.

## Usage

All you need to get started is your Access Token, which can be generated on
your [Settings Page](https://www.rev.ai/settings). Create a client with the
given Access Token:

```javascript
import { RevAiApiClient } from 'revai-node-sdk';

// Initialize your client with your revai access token
var accessToken = "Your Access Token";
var client = new RevAiApiClient(accessToken);
```

### Checking balance

```javascript
var accountInfo = await client.getAccount();
```

### Submitting a job

Once you've set up your client with your Access Token sending a file is easy!

```javascript
// you can submit a local file
var job = await client.submitJobLocalFile("./path/to/file.mp4");

// or submit via a public url
var job = await client.submitJobUrl("https://www.rev.ai/FTC_Sample_1.mp3");

// or from audio data, the filename is optional
const stream = fs.createReadStream("./path/to/file.mp3");
var job = await client.submitJobAudioData(stream, "file.mp3");
```

`job` will contain all the information normally found in a successful response from our
[Submit Job](https://www.rev.ai/docs#operation/SubmitTranscriptionJob) endpoint.

If you want to get fancy, both send job methods can take a `RevAiJobOptions` object which contains fields for `metadata`, `callback_url`, `skip_diarization`,`skip_punctuation`, `speaker_channels_count` and `custom_vocabularies` as optional parameters. These are also described in the request body of the [Submit Job](https://www.rev.ai/docs#operation/SubmitTranscriptionJob) endpoint.

### Checking your job's status

You can check the status of your transcription job using its `id`

```javascript
var jobDetails = await client.getJobDetails(job.id);
```

`jobDetails` will contain all information normally found in a successful response from
our [Get Job](https://www.rev.ai/docs#operation/GetJobById) endpoint

### Checking multiple files

You can retrieve a list of transcription jobs with optional parameters

```javascript
var jobs = await client.getListOfJobs();

// limit amount of retrieved jobs
var jobs = await client.getListOfJobs(3);

// get jobs starting after a certain job id
var jobs = await client.getListOfJobs(undefined, 'Umx5c6F7pH7r');
```

`jobs` will contain a list of job details having all information normally found in a successful response
from our [Get List of Jobs](https://www.rev.ai/docs#operation/GetListOfJobs) endpoint

### Deleting a job

You can delete a transcription job using its `id`

```javascript
await client.deleteJob(job.id);
```

 All data related to the job, such as input media and transcript, will be permanently deleted.
 A job can only by deleted once it's completed (either with success or failure).


### Getting your transcript

Once your file is transcribed, you can get your transcript in a few different forms:

```javascript
// as plain text
var transcriptText = await client.getTranscriptText(job.id);

// or as an object
var transcriptObject = await client.getTranscriptObject(job.id);
```

The text output is a string containing just the text of your transcript. The object form of the transcript contains all the information outlined in the response of the [Get Transcript](https://www.rev.ai/docs#operation/GetTranscriptById) endpoint when using the json response schema.

Any of these outputs can we retrieved as a stream for easy file writing:

```javascript
var textStream = await client.getTranscriptTextStream(job.id);
var transcriptStream = await client.getTranscriptObjectStream(job.id);
```

### Getting captions output

Another way to retrieve your file is captions output. We support both .srt and .vtt outputs. See below for an example showing how you can get captions as a readable stream. If your job was submitted with multiple speaker channels you are required to provide the id of the channel you would like captioned.

```javascript
var captionsStream = await client.getCaptions(job.id, CaptionType.SRT);

// with speaker channels
const channelId = 1;
var captionsStream = await client.getCaptions(job.id, CaptionType.VTT, channelId);
```
